    # When testing playbooks you have to tell ansible
the group you that we write in our hosts file.
For example 'servers' or what group you are using
in the playbook you want to test!

    group: # optional
    # When testing playbooks you have to give us
one example host we should use to test your playbook.
For example 'server1.example.com'.
We only spawn one docker container that mean
we can only test one host at the time. Sorry

    hosts: # optional
    # When testing playbooks and you are using ansible galaxy,
you may be interested in installing your requirements
from ansible galaxy.
To do this please provide us either the role name directly
-> e.g. 'do1jlr.ansible_version'
or your requiements.yml file.
-> e.g. 'requirements.yml'

    requirements: # optional
